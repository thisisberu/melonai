Each product formula features an exclusive Nutrilite ingredient such as pomegranate, black currant, citrus, white chia seed or green tea extract.</p>  <p><strong>What clinical study or laboratory support is available for Artistry Signature Select Body products?</strong></p>  <p>Clinical, consumer and laboratory tests were performed to support safety and efficacy claims. Studies were performed to ensure the formulas are well-tolerated, efficacious and satisfy consumer expectations.</p>  <p><strong>What skin types are best for Artistry Signature Select Body products?</strong></p>  <p>Every product is suitable for all skin types. Each product is designed to deliver a skincare benefit, so choose your products based on the benefit your skin needs. This allows you to personalize your routine.</p>  <p><strong>What inspired the different fragrances?</strong></p>  <p>We wanted to captivate the senses and make our products experiential. The fragrances were inspired by Nutrilite fruit and botanicals.</p>  <p><strong>Were Artistry Signature Select Body products tested on animals?</strong></p>  <p>No. The Artistry&trade; brand opposes animal testing and our products are not tested on animals unless required by government regulations. We actively support initiatives to create alternatives to required animal tests.</p>  <p><strong>Do the Artistry Signature Select Body products contain parabens?</strong></p>  <p>Artistry Signature Select Body products do not contain parabens.</p>  <p><strong>Where are the Artistry Signature Select Body products made?</strong></p>  <p>The Artistry Signature Select Body products are made in the USA.</p>  <p><strong>Is the packaging recyclable?</strong></p>  <p>The Artistry Signature Select Body product cartons are recyclable.</p>  <p><strong>Why is hydration important to the skin?</strong></p>  <p>Water is one of the most important elements to our body. We lose large amounts of water every single day and constantly need replenishment. Drinking water helps to re-hydrate your body from the inside but hydrating our skin on the outside is important too. When skin is hydrated, it can function more optimally.</p>  <p>Hydrated skin has multiple benefits:</p>  <ul> \t<li>Improving appearance &ndash; Hydrated skin is plumped up skin which looks better and functions better. It allows skin to perform at its healthiest</li> \t<li>Slows the aging process &ndash; Hydrated skin helps to maintain skin&rsquo;s elasticity and combats the visible signs of wrinkles</li> \t<li>Replenishment &ndash; Hydrated skin replenishes moisture that is lost so it maintains optimized hydration</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Why is the Hydrating Body Gel self-adjusting? </strong></p>  <p>Different parts of our body may be more, or less, hydrated. Rather than provide the same amount of moisture everywhere, Hydrating Body Gel contains a sugar molecule that teaches skin to hold moisture where it is needed most.</p>  <p><strong>Why is pollution damaging to my skin?</strong></p>  <p>When skin is compromised by pollution and free radical damage, skin is not only weak but loses hydration making it appear dry and unable to fight the signs of aging.</p>  <p><strong>What is unique about the Hydrating Body Gel formulation? </strong></p>  <p>The Hydrating Body Gel is a very lightweight hydrogel emulsion. Typically gel formulations feel light and are not very hydrating to skin. The Hydrating Body Gel, although lightweight in feel, provides deep, long-lasting moisture while hydrating skin for up to 48 hours.</p>  <p><strong>What ingredients make the Hydrating Body Gel unique and special?</strong></p>  <p>It&rsquo;s specially formulated with Nutrilite-sourced green tea extract and a blend of peach flower extract and evening primrose and perilla oils to help deep hydrate, nourish and protect skin.</p>  <p><strong>I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s a hydrating mask &ndash; what&rsquo;s that about?</strong></p>  <p>Yes, it&rsquo;s our Artistry Signature Select Hydrating Mask (122343). It has a smooth, whipped, souffl&eacute;-like texture that helps rehydrate and restore your skin in just 7 minutes.</p>", "url": "https://www.amway.com/en_US/Artistry-Signature-Select%E2%84%A2-Hydrating-Body-Gel--p-123858V"}, "123859V": {"itemName": "Artistry Signature Select™ Purifying Body Cleanser", "description": "<p>200 g / 7.05 oz.</p>  <p><strong>A clean slate &ndash; for your skin</strong></p>  <p>Your skin is no stranger to the daily assaults of sweat, dirt and extremely fine particles of airborne pollution.

For those young people with an incarcerated parent and family instability, the stigma and shame of parental incarceration converges with poverty, crime and failing public schools to create a dangerous mix of risk factors that significantly increase a child's chances of school failure and future incarceration.

The best way to determine your skin type is to pay close attention to your skin&rsquo;s reaction to external stimuli. If you answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to any of the questions below, you likely have skin sensitivity, and the Labs Retexturizing System may not be for you.</p>  <p><strong>Do you have reactive skin?</strong> Products such as soaps, detergents, fragrances, perfumes, skin care products and household products may cause your skin to react causing itchiness, dryness or reddening. In addition, exposure to cold, sun and wind can trigger flares.</p>  <p><strong>Is your skin prone to redness?</strong> Most people with sensitive skin deal with some amount of redness. This can take the form of a red rash, red bumps, blushing and flushing, or even red dilated blood vessels. Usually, the redness will go away after removing the irritant or with minor treatment.</p>  <p><strong>Are you experiencing excessive dry skin?</strong> Dry skin and sensitive skin can go hand-in-hand. It can lead to acne breakouts and cracked skin. You likely have more problems with dry skin in cold, dry weather and when exposed to wind.</p>  <p><strong>Is your skin prone to rashes?</strong> Sensitive skin may react with a red, dry, flaky or bumpy rash when exposed to a trigger. This is especially true for products that are left on your skin, such as facial creams. You may develop a rash very quickly after contact.</p>  <p><strong>Is your skin prone to breakouts?</strong> You may develop breakouts that look like acne with red bumps and pustules.</p>  <p><strong>Does your skin sunburn easily?</strong> You are more susceptible to the harmful effects of the sun.</p>  <p><strong>Clinical Results you&rsquo;ll love*:</strong></p>  <ul> \t<li>Artistry Labs Retexturizing System is clinically proven to improve skin&#39;s texture so skin looks 8 years younger in just 4 weeks.</li> \t<li>100% of panelists had smoother feeling skin.</li> \t<li>97% of panelists showed improvement in skin brightness.</li> \t<li>97% of panelists showed improvement in the appearance of fine lines.</li> \t<li>97% of panelists had softer feeling skin.</li> \t<li>86% of consumers agree they would do this system instead of a professional treatment.</li> </ul>  <p><sub>*after 4 weeks</sub></p>  <p><strong>Artistry&trade; Clean:</strong></p>  <ul> \t<li>Registered with The Vegan Society</li> \t<li>Not tested on animals</li> \t<li>No mineral oil</li> \t<li>No parabens</li> \t<li>No phthalates</li> \t<li>No animal-derived ingredients</li> </ul>  <p>All Artistry Labs&trade; products are created using Artistry Clean standards.
